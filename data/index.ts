This research combines theoretical understanding with practical experimentation, involving the creation and analysis of adversarial examples, designing countermeasures, and developing frameworks for robustness evaluation. I employ a range of techniques, including adversarial training, regularization methods, and robustness testing, with the goal of improving the security and reliability of AI models in high-stakes environments. This work requires continuous learning, experimentation, and cross-disciplinary insight into cybersecurity and AI ethics, aiming to make AI models safer and more trustworthy.",
